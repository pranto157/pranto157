# Sayed Raianul Kabir
Backend Engineer

## About Me
My journey revolves around software engineering, innovation, and creating impactful experiences. 

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to cutting-edge projects and collaborated with industry’s sharpest minds. Currently, I’m a core member of Shore GmbH’s team, pivotal in designing and executing a robust payment gateway powered by Stripe. This integration bolsters an existing SaaS-based POS application, ensuring seamless transactions in the dynamic world of digital commerce.

My professional journey commenced at NewsCred, where I started as a Software Engineer. Through dedication and continuous learning, I advanced to take on more responsibilities and challenges. Leading a team of four, I orchestrated the complete overhaul of the Smart Press application. This transformation, driven by my expertise in software design, prototyping, and meticulous investigation, was a resounding success. Later, I managed the Newscred Ingestion System. This product efficiently collected news from publishers like AP, AFP, Reuters, and Getty Images, providing customers with accessible APIs for news search and filtering.
